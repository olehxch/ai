# üß¨ Artificial Intelligence - Science, Research & Engineering

‚ú® It is a curated collection of remarkable and inspirational material on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other topics related to the appliance of intelligent approaches to robotics, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, microservices, and software design.
I've personally read most of the materials and had a chance to work with source code examples for my research and learning purposes. I constantly update this list whenever interesting material appears.

‚ö°Ô∏è You can subscribe to my Medium account to read articles about artificial intelligence, cloud computing, state-of-the-art technologies, and also audio engineering! Here is a link:
